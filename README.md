# UnityBitMaskDrawer
Unity BitMaskDrawer implements a default inspector for bitmask flag enums allowing multiple enums without a custom inspector, originally by Bunny83
* Code by Bunny83 http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/393992/custom-inspector-multi-select-enum-dropdown.html
* Probably similar to https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/?#!/content/12206 which is just $5 if you want to support a paid version
